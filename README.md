# nucleo144-rs

Basic Rust board support package for the [Nucleo-144 development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f767zi.html) targeting the STM32F767ZI microcontroller. The current goal is to get familiar with the embedded Rust ecosystem, rather than provide any real package. Uses [stm32f7xx_hal](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f7xx-hal/).
